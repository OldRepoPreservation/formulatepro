= Do you offer !FormulatePro for Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) or lower? =

Sorry, but !FormulatePro is Tiger and Leopard-only. !FormulatePro uses Apple technology (specifically PDFKit) which is Tiger and Leopard-only, hence the requirement.

*No!*

Do one of the following instead:
  * Post to the [http://groups.google.com/group/formulatepro discussion group]
  * Within the program, choose Menu Bar->!FormulatePro->Provide !FormulatePro Feedback by Email

If you do one of these, you should generally get a reply within 24 hours.
